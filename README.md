# CookingCompanion: A Recipe Management System
***Currently under construction 5/25/24***
## Overview
Welcome to my CookingCompanion repository! This is a project I created to store all of my recipes and for quickly retrieving recipes. I noticed that manually adding recipes to my NoSQL database was time consuming so I decided to create an app that will ease the process and act as my own recipe library. This management system is designed to help users organize, create, and share their favorite recipes.
