# CookingCompanion: A Recipe Management System
***Under construction***
## Overview
Welcome to my CookingCompanion repository! This is a full-stack web application that allows users to sign up or sign in to their account where they can input their recipes into a database, search for recipes based on various inputs, and view a dashboard with information about their data. This is a project I created to store all of my recipes and for quick retrieval. I noticed that manually adding recipes to my database was time consuming so I decided to create an app that will ease the process and act as my own recipe library. This management system is designed to help users organize, create, and share their favorite recipes.
